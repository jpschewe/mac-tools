  This is an applescript based launch agent, that checks once per day
  for available software updates. If there are any, it announces them
  as a Growl notification or - if it is not installed - as a system
  dialog. This agent also works for users without administrative rights.

  To install it, move this file to ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ and
  re-login or execute
  launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/de.anderson.sven.updateCheck.plist

  Installing Growl is highly recommended: http://growl.info/

To make this work nicely you'll need to add the following to your sudoers
file with "sudo visudo":

<your username> ALL=NOPASSWD:/usr/sbin/softwareupdate

You'll still need to manually run Software Update from the Apple menu to install the updates, but at least now you'll be notified when.
